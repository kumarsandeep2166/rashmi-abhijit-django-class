Functions Based
----------------
1. Simple to define
2. Easy to callable
3. no explicit modules required to inherit
4. Process is not secure
5. Multiple requests cannot be handled.
6. Easy to cutomise 
7. Hard to extend and reuse the code
8. Handling of HTTP methods via conditional branching

class Based Views
-----------------
1. Quiet difficult to customise
2. Mutiple requests can be easily handled.
3. explicit modules are required to perform actions
4. It is defined under a class so it must have class properties.
5. Better code reusablity
6. process is much secure than FBV
7. Can use O.O techniques such as mixins (multiple inheritance)
8. Handling of HTTP methods by separate class methods
9. Built-in generic class-based views
