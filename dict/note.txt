dictionary is a data structure available in python where the elements are stored in the form of key and value.
this means one key has one value.
the first element is considered as the key and the second element is considered as value.
the key and values are differentiated by (:).
{'a':12}--- a is the key and 12 is the value of a
all the key and value pairs are stored inside {}
indexing and slicing operation is not possible in dictionary
the keys must be unique means once a key is used cannot be duplicated.but the values can be duplicated.
d={'a':12, 'b':13,'c':14,'d':15,'e':16}
d={}
methods
--------
name              example                 description
----------------------------------------------------------------------
clear()          d.clear()                 removes all elements from dictionary
copy()           d1=d.copy()               copies all element from d to d1
fromkeys()       d.fromkeys(s[,v])         create a new dictionary with keys from sequence 's'
                                            and values all set to value

get()           d.get(k[,v])               returns the value associated with the key'k'. it returns v
                                             if k is not found,it returns -1                    

items()         d.items()                   returns an object that contains key-value pairs of d.
                                            the pairs are stored as tuples in the object

keys()          d.keys()                    returns a sequence of keys from dictionary 'd'
values()        d.values()                  returns a sequence of values from dictionary 'd'
update()        d.update(x)                 adds all element from dictionary 'x' to 'd'
pop()           d.pop(k[,v])                removes the key'k' and its value from 'd'


find the occurance of each letter present in the string using dictionary
str = "Temple City Bhubaneswar"
